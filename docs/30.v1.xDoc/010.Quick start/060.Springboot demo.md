This Demo demonstrates the seamless integration between Easy-Es and the Springboot project. It is strongly recommended to download it first and run it directly in your local area to avoid stepping on the pit due to version compatibility issues such as springboot when integrating it yourself.

:::tip special attention
Please refer to the figure below to get the latest version of the latest version currently released. The actual version number is filled in, such as 1.0.0, not the latest version!!!

In addition, because springboot is built-in associated with the es version, different springboot versions will cause the es dependency version introduced in the actual project to be too low or too high.
However, the compatibility of different versions of es is relatively poor, causing many users to step on the pit of some compatibility problems. I hereby remind users that if the version of es that your project actually depends on is not
For version 7.14.0, we strongly recommend that you specify that the es-dependent jar package version is 7.14.0, which is consistent with the es-dependent version we use at the bottom, so the compatibility is the best,
It is not easy to step on the pit. The reason why the bottom layer adopts 7.14.0 is also after multiple investigations, and a stable version without security vulnerabilities was selected, which was scanned by Murphy to be safe and reliable.
As for the ES client version, the 7.10+ measured compatibility is very good. It doesn't matter if the jar package version in the dependency does not match the client version, the focus is on the dependent Jar version.

## 3. Core code

````java
@RestController
@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Autowired))
public class TestUseEeController {
    private final DocumentMapper documentMapper;
    
    @GetMapping("/insert")
    public Integer insert() {
        // Initialize -> add data
        Document document = new Document();
        document.setTitle("man");
        document.setContent("muscle man");
        return documentMapper.insert(document);
    }

    @GetMapping("/search")
    public List<Document> search() {
        // Query a list of all documents with the title man
        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Document> wrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        wrapper.eq(Document::getTitle, "man");
        return documentMapper.selectList(wrapper);
    }
}
````

## 4. Start and use

### a.Add configuration information
````yaml
easy-es:
  enable: true # The default is true, if it is false, the framework is considered not to be enabled
  address : 127.0.0.0:9200 #Fill in your es connection address
  # username: Fill in only if there are settings, not required
  # password: Fill in only if there are settings, not required
````
### b.Start the project
Start the project with your IDE
<br />

![image.png](https://iknow.hs.net/b6d12f86-58db-45ad-af05-29ab9b398614.png)

If your configuration is correct and the ES version and Springboot version are compatible, you will see that the ES index is automatically created by the framework and output in the console:
===>Congratulations auto process index by Easy-Es is done !

### c.Use

[http://localhost:8080/insert](http://localhost:8080/insert) (Click to insert data)

[http://localhost:8080/search](http://localhost:8080/search) (Click to query)

## 5 Conclusion

At this point, you have initially experienced the basic functions of Easy-Es. If you feel that the experience is not bad, and want to experience more powerful functions, then keep reading!
