## Version update plan

The long-awaited 1.0 stable version is officially launched together with the new official website and documentation, which will significantly reduce the release frequency, because the functions are basically mature and very rich, and can be safely put into production in the production environment.
The later iterations will also be slower, and strive to be as stable as an old dog. API stability will be ranked first. In addition, the time saved will be used for project promotion, so that more people can use EE.
