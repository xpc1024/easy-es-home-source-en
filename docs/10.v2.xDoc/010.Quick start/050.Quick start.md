:::tip
If you have used Mybatis-Plus, you can basically get started without having to read more than this documentation
Easy-Es is a flat version of Mybatis-Plus for Elastic Search.
:::

We will illustrate the power of Easy-Es with a simple demo, before that we assume that you have.

- Have a Java development environment and the appropriate IDE
- Familiarity with MySQL
- Familiarity with Spring Boot (recommended version 2.5.x +)
- Familiarity with Maven
- Understand the basic concepts of Es or have read the [avoidance guide](/pages/4c01d7/) (highly recommended)
- Es installed **recommended version 7.x** (not installed by their own Baidu tutorials, it is recommended to install an es-head plug-in, to facilitate visual verification), low version may exist API incompatibility or other unknown cases, because the underlying RestHighLevelClient rather than RestLowLevelClient, the demo uses Es version is 7.14.0

:::tip Recommended
We recommend you to refer to this [Springboot integration demo](/pages/e12389/), it will help you save more time.
:::

:::tip Special Note
Because springboot has a built-in version of es, different versions of springboot may cause the actual project to introduce a low or high version of es dependency,
Many users have stepped into some compatibility problems due to conflicting dependencies, so we would like to remind you that if the actual es version that your project depends on is not
7.14.0 version, we strongly recommend that you show the specified es dependency jar package version for 7.14.0, and we use the underlying es dependency version to maintain consistency, so the best compatibility,
It is not easy to step in the hole. The reason for the underlying 7.14.0 is also after much research, the choice of a stable version without security vulnerabilities, by Murphy scan the version is safe and reliable.
As for the ES client version, 7.10+ tested compatibility are very good, the dependency of the jar package version and the client version does not matter, the focus is on the dependency of the Jar version.

## Initialize the project

Create an empty Spring Boot project

:::tip
You can use [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to quickly initialize a Spring Boot project
:::

## Add dependencies

**Maven:**

```xml
        <!-- Introduce dependencies for the latest version of easy-es -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>cn.easy-es</groupId>
            <artifactId>easy-es-boot-starter</artifactId>
            <!-- Here Latest Version refers to the latest version of the dependency, such as 2.0.0, which can be obtained from the image below -->
            <version>Latest Version</version>
        </dependency>

        <!-- exclude the built-in es dependency in springboot to prevent conflicts with the easy-es dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId
                    <artifactId>elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client</artifactId
                </exclusion>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
                    <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>
            <artifactId>elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client</artifactId>
            <version>7.14.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>
            <artifactId>elasticsearch</artifactId>
            <version>7.14.0</version>
        </dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```groovy
compile group: 'cn.easy-es', name: 'easy-es-boot-starter', version: 'Latest Version'
```

## âœ¨ Latest Version Latest Version: [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/xpc1024/easy-es?include_prereleases&logo=xpc&style=plastic)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.github.xpc1024%20a:easy-*)

## Configuration

In the application.yml configuration file add the relevant configuration that EasyEs must have.
```yaml
easy-es:
  enable: true #default is true, if false then the framework is not enabled
  address : 127.0.0.1:9200 # es's connection address, must include the port If it is a cluster, it can be separated by a comma Example: 127.0.0.1:9200,127.0.0.2:9200
  username: elastic #If not, you can omit this line
  password: WG7WVmuNMtM4GwNYkyWH #If not, then this line can be omitted
````
Other configurations can be omitted for the time being, and there will be a section describing the configuration of EasyEs in detail later

Add the @EsMapperScan annotation to the Spring Boot startup class and scan the Mapper folder for.
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EsMapperScan("com.xpc.eases.sample.mapper")
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```
## Background

There is a Document document table. With the expansion of the data volume, its query efficiency can no longer meet the product requirements. The table structure is as follows. We plan to migrate the content of this table to the Es search engine to improve query efficiency.

| id | title | content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| primary key | title | content |

## Coding

Write entity class Document.java (here we use [Lombok](https://www.projectlombok.org/) to simplify the code)
```java
@Data
public class Document {
    /**
     * Unique id in es
     */	
    private String id;
    /**
     * Document title
     */
    private String title;
    /**
     * Document content
     private String title; */
    private String content;
}
```

:::tip
- The above field names and underscores to auto-hump, field storage types in ES, separators, etc. are configurable and will be introduced in the next sections.
- String type will be created by EE as keyword type by default, keyword type supports exact query, etc.
- If you want to split the query, you can add the @TableField annotation to the field and specify the field type as text, and specify the splitter, just like content above.
  
:::

Write Mapper class DocumentMapper.java
```java
public interface DocumentMapper extends BaseEsMapper<Document> {
}
```
##Preceding operations

Start the project, Easy-Es will automatically help you to create an index (equivalent to a table in a database such as MySQL), with the index to carry out subsequent CRUD operations. After the index is hosted successfully, you can see in the console: ===> Congratulations auto process index by Easy-Es is done !

:::tip
- If the index is updated, index rebuilding, updating, data migration, etc. will be done automatically by EE by default, but you can also turn off the automatic index hosting through the configuration, you can maintain it manually through the API provided by EE or es-head and other plug-ins.
- Auto-hosting mode (supported by version 0.9.9+), the relevant configuration and detailed description can be seen in the later chapters, here you can just give these annoying steps to EE to automatically handle it.
- If your EE version is lower than this version, you can maintain the index manually through the API provided by EE
  
:::

## Getting Started (CRUD)

Add a test class for functional testing.

> Test Add: Add a new data (equivalent to Insert operation in MySQL)

```java
    @Test
    public void testInsert() {
        // Test inserting data
        Document document = new Document();
        document.setTitle("Old man");
        document.setContent("push * technology is too hard");
        int successCount = documentMapper.insert(document);
        System.out.println(successCount);
    }
```
> test query: query the specified data based on the conditions (equivalent to the Select operation in MySQL)

``` java
    @Test
    public void testSelect() {
        // test query write the same as MP can be chained, or not chained according to the use of flexible choice can be
        String title = "Old man";
        Document document = EsWrappers.lambdaChainQuery(documentMapper)
                 .eq(Document::getTitle, title)
                 .one();
        System.out.println(document);
}
```
