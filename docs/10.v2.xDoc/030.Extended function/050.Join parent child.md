:::tip preface
The bottom layer of ES is Lucene. Because Lucene actually does not support nested types, all documents are stored in Lucene in a flat structure. In fact, ES supports parent-child documents in an opportunistic way.

Parent-child documents are stored as independent documents, and then the relationship is added, and the parent-child documents must be in the same slice. Because the parent-child type documents do not reduce the number of documents and increase the parent-child binding relationship, the query efficiency will be low, so we do not recommend you to use the parent-child type in actual development.

ES itself is more suitable for the "big-wide table" mode, instead of using ES with the traditional thinking mode of relational database. We can completely accomplish the desired function by merging the fields and contents of multiple tables into one table (an index), avoiding the use of parent-child types as much as possible, which is not only efficient, but also more powerful.

Of course, it is reasonable to exist, and there are indeed some cases where father-son types will inevitably be used. As the world's leading ES-ORM framework, we also provide support for this, users can do without it, but we can't do without it!

About the choice of parent-child type and nested type: If you write more than you read, you are advised to choose parent-child type; if you read more than you write, you should choose nested type.

## Parent-child type create index

-Automatic transmission mode:
```java
/**
* parent document
*/
@IndexName(childClass = Comment.class)
public class Document{
//Omit other fields ...
/**
* It is necessary to indicate its type as Join, its parent name and child name in the entity class of parent document and child document through comments. The framework of JoinField class here has been built in, and there is no need to make wheels repeatedly.
* The full path of the joinfield class is cn.easies.com mon.params.joinfield. If you have to make your own wheels and support them, you need to indicate in the @TableField annotation that the joinFieldClass= the wheels you made.
*/
@IndexField(fieldType = FieldType.JOIN, parentName = "document", childName = "comment")
private JoinField joinField;
}
/**
* subdocuments
*/
@IndexName(child = true)
public class Comment {
//Omit other fields ...
/**
* The parent-child relationship field must indicate its type as Join in the entity classes of the parent document and the child document through comments, and the parent-child relationship in the child document can be omitted.
*/
@IndexField(fieldType = FieldType.JOIN)
private JoinField joinField;
}
```
> * * Note: * * Be sure to annotate @TableName on the parent document's class to indicate its child document's class, annotate @TableName on the child document's class to indicate that child=true, and specify the type as fieldType=JOIN and its parent name and child name in the @TableField annotation of JoinField class, otherwise the framework will not work properly.

-Manual shift mode
-Mode 1:
According to the automatic transmission mode, configure the annotation, and then directly call the one-click generation API to generate the index.

```java
documentMapper.createIndex();
```
-Mode 2:
It is made by hand, and all fields are arranged by yourself. It is not recommended, which is very troublesome.
```java
LambdaEsIndexWrapper<Document> wrapper = new LambdaEsIndexWrapper<>();
//Omit other codes
wrapper.join("joinField", "document", "comment");
```

:::tip attention
In the manual shift mode, there are still many comments on the main class, and the parent-child relationship is needed when the framework runs. In the second mode, the nested field needs to be specified through wrapper, and then the index is created/updated.

## parent-child type CRUD

Note that the parent and child types are independent documents, independent entity classes, so they need to have their own mapper

CRUD example:
```java
    @Test
    public void testInsert() {
        // test the new parent document, where the automatic blocking mode is turned on, the parent-child type index has been automatically processed
        // the new parent document, and then insert the child document
        Document document = new Document();
        document.setId("1");
        document.setTitle("title of the parent document");
        document.setContent("content of the parent document");
        JoinField joinField = new JoinField();
        joinField.setName("document");
        document.setJoinField(joinField);
        documentMapper.insert(document);

        // insert sub-document
        Comment comment = new Comment();
        comment.setId("2");
        comment.setCommentContent("Document Comment 1");

        // special attention here, the child document must specify the id of its parent document, otherwise do not find the parent document do not blame me for not reminding
        joinField.setParent("1");
        joinField.setName("comment");
        comment.setJoinField(joinField);
        commentMapper.insert(comment);

        // insert sub-document 2
        Comment comment1 = new Comment();
        comment1.setId("3");
        comment1.setCommentContent("document comment2");
        comment1.setJoinField(joinField);
        commentMapper.insert(comment1);
    }

    @Test
    public void testSelect() {
        // Warm tip, the type in the following wrapper is actually the parentName and childName specified in the JoinField field annotation @TableField, which is the same as the native syntax
        // case1: hasChild query, the return is the relevant parent document so the query with the parent document entity and its mapper
        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Document> documentWrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        documentWrapper.hasChild("comment", FieldUtils.val(Comment::getCommentContent), "Comment");
        List<Document> documents = documentMapper.selectList(documentWrapper);
        System.out.println(documents);

        // case2: hasParent query, the return is the relevant sub-document so the query with the sub-document entity and its mapper
        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Comment> commentWrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        // field name you can also not FieldUtils.val, directly passed into the string will also work
        commentWrapper.hasParent("document", "content", "content");
        List<Comment> comments = commentMapper.selectList(commentWrapper);
        System.out.println(comments);

        // case3: parentId query, the return is the relevant sub-document, similar to case2, so the query with the sub-document entity and its mapper
        commentWrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        commentWrapper.parentId("1", "comment");
        List<Comment> commentList = commentMapper.selectList(commentWrapper);
        System.out.println(commentList);
    }

    @Test
    public void testUpdate() {
        // case1: parent document/child document updated according to their respective ids
        Document document = new Document();
        document.setId("1");
        document.setTitle("Parent Title");
        documentMapper.updateById(document);

        // case2: parent document/child document updated according to their respective conditions
        Comment comment = new Comment();
        comment.setCommentContent("Updated comment");
        LambdaEsUpdateWrapper<Comment> wrapper = new LambdaEsUpdateWrapper<>();
        wrapper.match(Comment::getCommentContent, "Comment");
        commentMapper.update(comment, wrapper);
    }

    @Test
    public void testDelete() {
        // case1: parent document/child document deleted according to their respective ids
        documentMapper.deleteById("1");

        // case2: parent document/child document delete according to their respective conditions
        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Comment> wrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        wrapper.match(Comment::getCommentContent, "Comment");
        commentMapper.delete(wrapper);
    }
```

## Bad taste

At present, the parent-child type document automatically create index/manual block one-click mode does not yet support a father and multiple children scenario, if you have such scenarios, you must customize the mode through the manual block or through other tools to create the index, because the parent-child type is used by very few people, such features are low priority, we will support in subsequent iterations.
