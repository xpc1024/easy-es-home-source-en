        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Document> wrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        String keyword = "overdrive";
        float contentBoost = 5.0f;
        wrapper.match(Document::getContent,keyword,contentBoost);
        String creator = "old man";
        float creatorBoost = 2.0f;
        wrapper.eq(Document::getCreator,creator,creatorBoost);
        SearchResponse response = documentMapper.search(wrapper);
        System.out.println(response);
    }
```

:::tip Warm tips
If you need to score, then return through SearchResponse, if you do not need to score, just need to return according to the high score of the first rank, then directly with `List<T>` to receive can.
