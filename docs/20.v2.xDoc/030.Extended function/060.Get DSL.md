## API

```java
//Obtaining the query parameters generated by this framework can be used to check whether the query parameters generated by this framework are correct and other purposes.
String getSource(LambdaEsQueryWrapper<T> wrapper);
```

:::tip
If you get DSL statements only for printing, you don't need to call this interface manually to get DSL statements. DSL statements will be printed on the console by default. If the production environment needs to be closed, please configure print-dsl=false in the configuration file. Please refer to the configuration section for configuration.
