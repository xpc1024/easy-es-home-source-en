:::tip Tips
If you get DSL statements just for printing, you donâ€™t need to manually call this interface to get DSL statements. The DSL statements will be printed on the console by default. If you need to close the production environment, please configure print-dsl=false in the configuration file. For the configuration, please refer to Configuration chapter.
