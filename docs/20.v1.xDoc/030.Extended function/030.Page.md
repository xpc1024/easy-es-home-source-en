> Regarding paging, we support three paging modes of ES, you can refer to the following table and choose according to your needs.

| Paging Method | Performance | Advantages | Disadvantages | Application Scenarios |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| from+size | Low | Good flexibility, easy to implement | Deep paging problem | The amount of data is relatively small, can tolerate deep paging problems |
| scroll | Medium | Solved the problem of deep paging | Unable to reflect the real-time nature of data | Export of massive data requires querying the data of massive result sets |
| search_after | High | The best performance, there is no deep paging problem, and it can reflect real-time changes in data | The implementation is complex, requiring a globally unique field. The implementation of continuous paging will be more complicated, because each query requires the last query As a result, it is not suitable for large page jump queries | paging of massive data |


## from+size
````java
    // physical paging
    EsPageInfo<T> pageQuery(LambdaEsQueryWrapper<T> wrapper, Integer pageNum, Integer pageSize);
````

:::tip Tips
You can use paging query without integrating any plug-ins. This query belongs to physical paging, based on size+from shallow paging mode, which is suitable for query data less than 10,000, if you need
In some high-level syntax usage scenarios, there are currently known aggregate field returns, which our pager cannot support yet. You need to encapsulate the paging by yourself. Other scenarios can basically be perfectly supported, and it is extremely simple to use.
Note that PageInfo is provided by this framework. If you already have the most popular open source paging plugin PageHelper in your project, please be careful not to introduce errors when importing the package. EE uses the same return fields as PageHelper, so you don't need to worry about the field names The extra workload caused by non-uniformity.

> Example of use:

````java
    @Test
    public void testPageQuery() {
        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Document> wrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        wrapper.match(Document::getTitle, "Old man");
        EsPageInfo<Document> documentPageInfo = documentMapper.pageQuery(wrapper,1,10);
        System.out.println(documentPageInfo);
    }
````

## scroll query

````java
    // scroll query
    SearchResponse scroll(SearchScrollRequest searchScrollRequest, RequestOptions requestOptions) throws IOException;
````

:::tip
If you need to perform a large amount of data query and paging requirements, you can use scrolling query to achieve it. Regarding scrolling query, we have actually provided getSearchSourceBuilder API to quickly construct SearchSourceBuilder. With the scrolling query API provided above, it can help you quickly Implement scrolling queries
Of course, we recommend that you use the following searchAfter method for paging, not only the API is better encapsulated and easier to use, but also has other natural advantages.

## searchAfter

> Example of use:

````java
    @Test
    public void testSearchAfter() {
        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Document> lambdaEsQueryWrapper = EsWrappers.lambdaQuery(Document.class);
        lambdaEsQueryWrapper.size(10);
        // A sorting rule must be specified, and the sorting field value must be unique. Here I choose to use id to sort. Actually, it can be freely specified according to the business scenario. It is not recommended to use the creation time, because it may be the same        lambdaEsQueryWrapper.orderByDesc(Document::getStarNum);
        lambdaEsQueryWrapper.orderByDesc(Document::getId);
        SAPageInfo<Document> saPageInfo = documentMapper.searchAfterPage(lambdaEsQueryWrapper, null, 10);
        // The first page
        System.out.println(saPageInfo);
        Assertions.assertEquals(10, saPageInfo.getList().size());

        // get the next page
        List<Object> nextSearchAfter = saPageInfo.getNextSearchAfter();
        SAPageInfo<Document> next = documentMapper.searchAfterPage(lambdaEsQueryWrapper, nextSearchAfter, 10);
        Assertions.assertEquals(10, next.getList().size());
    }
````

:::tip
When using searchAfter, you must specify the ordering. If there is no ordering, it will not only report an error, but also be unfriendly to page jumps.
It is necessary to keep the searchAfter sorting unique, otherwise the paging will be invalid. It is recommended to use id, uuid, etc. for sorting.
