## Closing Remarks
We would like to thank Jaime (Mr. Yang), a new community developer, for his significant contributions that enabled the early release of version 3.0. Rigorous testing and code reviews have been conducted before the launch. We welcome you to upgrade and try out the new version. Should you encounter any defects, please do not hesitate to inform us. We will promptly verify and fix them. We will continue to iterate and improve, and though better features may be delayed, they will never be absent.
