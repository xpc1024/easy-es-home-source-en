## v2.0.0-beta1

2.0.0-beta1 is the first release of Easy-Es in 2023, sorry for the late arrival of version 2.0.

This is a milestone release, not a minor one, so it has been a long time coming, with the algorithms for the four nested query types taking nearly a year of fragmentation to explore.

2.0.0-beta1 provides more than 10 new features, more than 10 enhancements, one bug fix, and further documentation on the official website and a full project presentation PPT.

## When will 2.0.0 be released?

The plan is to complete the 2.0 release in the first half of this year, which is already a full six months ahead of the original plan
The reason why v2.0.0-beta1 was released first is because this 2.0 version is really a big change, the core code was changed almost once,
In order to ensure the stability and reliability of 2.0.0, and to win the reputation of EE, we plan to push it in 4 versions
- v2.0.0-beta1 Push all features and improvements
- v2.0.0-beta2 Push jackson to replace fastjson version and improve feedback and fix possible defects in beta1
- v2.0.0-beta3 Push improvements in beta2 and fix possible bugs
- v2.0.0 Push the official version

## Can 2.0.0-beta1 be used in production?

My answer is yes, but only if you will modify the source code yourself, or if your company does not use ES for core scenarios, such as basic document retrieval or some non-2C business, even though our version is called beta,
But before going online are strictly tested, there are a large number of automated test cases cover to ensure that the core functionality is stable and reliable, the user in the process of use for the development of good features can also be tested again, so basically can complete the production
In case there is a known defect, you can solve it by mixing or modifying the source code, and we will also fix the defects in beta1 in beta2.

## Four major nested queries support

In fact, there have been 2 algorithm tuning in this area, plus this is the third time, the first two of which were on the wrong path, so the best results could not be achieved even after racking our brains,
So the version before 2.X in more than 2 levels of nested complex queries can not be achieved by the way out of the box. After a year-long exploration, we finally solved 4 kinds of nested queries and support stepless nesting,
No matter how complex the query conditions are, no matter how deep the hierarchy is, you can easily handle it.

|MySQL |Mybatis-Plus |ES | Easy-Es |
|--------------| -------------- | ------------|--------------------|
|and splice    |default |must |default
|or splice     |or() | should | or() |
|none          |none | filter | filter() |
|none          |none | must_not | not() |

Visual comparison
```java
      // MySQL syntax  
      where business_type = 1
              and (state = 9 or (state = 8 and bidding_sign = 1))
              or (business_type = 2 and state in (2,3));

      // Easy-Es and Mybatis-Plus syntax 
      wrapper.eq("business_type", 1)
                   .and(a -> a.eq("state", 9).or(b -> b.eq("state", 8).eq("bidding_sign", 1)))
                   .or(i -> i.eq("business_type", 2).in("state", 2, 3));
        

      // ES native RestHighLevel syntax
      List<Integer> values = Arrays.asList(2, 3);
      BoolQueryBuilder boolQueryBuilder = QueryBuilders.boolQuery();
      boolQueryBuilder.must(QueryBuilders.termQuery("business_type", 1));
      boolQueryBuilder.must(QueryBuilders.boolQuery()); boolQueryBuilder.must(QueryBuilders.termQuery()
	                  .must(QueryBuilders.termQuery("state", 9))
                                    .should(QueryBuilders.boolQuery().must(QueryBuilders.termQuery("state", 8))
                                    .must(QueryBuilders.termQuery("bidding_sign", 1))));
      boolQueryBuilder.should(QueryBuilders.boolQuery().must(QueryBuilders.termQuery("business_type", 2))
               	                   .must(QueryBuilders.termsQuery("state", values)));
```
>The maximum depth of the tree in the above example is only 2. If the depth exceeds 2, the ES native syntax will be difficult to understand, let alone code correctly, and even if you are an ES veteran, you will easily fall into the hole, but now you can easily and simply restore complex SQL with EE 1:1.

## Full query support for nested types

In version 1.X, the out-of-the-box query API for nested types only supported match, in version 2.x you can support all nested types of queries, just pass them in as Consumers, contributed by community developer @lym
- API

```java
nested(String path, Consumer<Param> consumer);
```

- Use the demo
```java
    @Test
    public void testNestedMatch() {
        // nested query query for age equal to 18 or 8 and password equal to 123
        LambdaEsQueryWrapper<Document> wrapper = new LambdaEsQueryWrapper<>();
        wrapper.nested(FieldUtils.val(Document::getUsers), w ->
                w.in(FieldUtils.val(User::getAge), 18, 8)
                        .eq(FieldUtils.val(User::getPassword), "123"));
        List<Document> documents = documentMapper.selectList(wrapper);
        System.out.println(documents);
    }
```

## Auto-splice .keyword suffix based on context

The default field type is adjusted from keyword to text_keyword when the index is created, and the .keyword suffix will be automatically and intelligently spliced according to the query type and the type configured in the annotation,
keyword suffix, and can be configured to turn on/off auto-splicing, which can enhance the range of field query support, reduce user workload, and significantly reduce the possibility of white people stepping on the ES pit.

## All conditional constructors support chaining

All conditional constructors support chained calls (including indexing), and MP like chaining programming

```java
    @Test
    public void testOne() {
        // chain call
        Document document = EsWrappers.lambdaChainQuery(documentMapper).eq(Document::getTitle, "Test Document 3").one();
    }
```

## Distance is much simpler to get

@Distance get distance annotation, new support for multiple fields, multiple sorters, and no longer need to manually specify the sorting iterator position by the user, the framework is fully automated processing, easier to use.

## other new features
- New field type wildcard type manual automatic gearbox are applicable
- provide index manual refresh interface , the trigger is freely controlled by the user , the previous index refresh policy configuration still retains automatic + manual matching
- Provide support for direct execution of static DSL statements
- Provide direct execution of SQL API
- Provide the function of setting route by custom annotation

## Other optimizations

- Remove the original not-headed API and the APIs that indicate the inverse (historical reasons, unreasonable design, decided to completely deprecate), such as notIn, notBetween, NE, etc. Now all the inverse can be directly solved by the not provided in the four nested types
- geo geographic query into the Bool query conditions, you can also enjoy must/should/filter/mustNot, the original function is not affected, can be interpreted as more powerful and flexible
- Deprecated the configuration item enableMust2Filter, you can directly use filter nesting simpler, more standardized, finer granularity
- Refactored WrapperProcess core logic and AbstractWrapper core logic Code structure is clearer, core logic is simpler and easier to read than the original, basically fool level, easy to maintain a higher level of maintenance
- Mark the array type and object type in the obsolete FieldType, and explain the correct type that should be used by commenting to prevent es from stepping on the pit.
- Adjust the default value of rebuilding index timeout to 72H and the default value of socketTimeOut and other parameters to further prevent white people from stepping on the index migration timeout failure.
- Add the default maximum connection timeout and heartbeat time, and give a suitable value to help the little white guys who don't know ES to step on the pit as much as possible.
- @Distance gets the distance annotation, which supports multi-field and multi-sorter functions, and it doesn't need the user to manually specify the position of sorting iterator, which is automatically handled by the framework, making it easier to use.
- Further enriched the official website document, using it more foolishly, and each overloaded method in the source code is annotated, making it more user-friendly.

## Defect fix

Fix the inaccuracy of the decimal place of the distance retained by the @Distance annotation in some scenarios.
