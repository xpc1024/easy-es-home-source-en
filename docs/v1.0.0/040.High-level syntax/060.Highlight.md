:::tip Tips
Highlighting fields can be achieved by custom annotation @HighLight, which can be added to the fields that need to be highlighted
:::

## Annotation usage example

````java
public class Document{
    /**
     * Fields that need to be highlighted
     */
    @HighLight
    private String content;
    // Omit other extraneous fields...
}
````

:::tip Tips
If you do not want the original field value to be overwritten by the highlighted field, then you need to specify the mappingField in the @HighLight annotation and add the field to the corresponding entity class. After this configuration, the highlighted content is returned in the highlightContent field, and the original content The value of the field still returns its own value.
:::

E.g:
````java
public class Document{
    /**
     * Fields that need to be highlighted
     */
    @HighLight(mappingField = "highlightContent")
    private String content;
    /**
     * Highlight the field whose return value is mapped
     */
    private String highlightContent;
    // Omit other extraneous fields...
}
````
